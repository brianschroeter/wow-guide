## 1. Addon Manager Setup

Addons are managed outside the game now. Pick **one** of these (both work great):

### Option A: CurseForge (More Popular)
- [ ] Download: https://www.curseforge.com/download/app
- [ ] Install and launch
- [ ] Click "World of Warcraft" to detect your installation
- [ ] You're ready to browse/install addons

### Option B: WowUp (Lighter Weight)
- [ ] Download: https://wowup.io/
- [ ] Install and launch
- [ ] It auto-detects your WoW installation
- [ ] You're ready to browse/install addons

## 2. Essential Addons

Install these through CurseForge or WowUp (search by name):

| Addon | What It Does | Priority |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **GTFO** | Screams at you when you're standing in fire/poison/bad stuff. Lifesaver in dungeons. | 🔴 Must Have |
| **Deadly Boss Mods (DBM)** | Timers and warnings for dungeon/raid boss abilities. Everyone uses this. | 🔴 Must Have |
| **Details!** | Damage/healing meters. See how you're performing. Nice for dungeons. | 🟡 Recommended |
| **Bagnon** | Combines all your bags into one big window. Major QoL improvement. | 🟡 Recommended |

Zygor is a premium leveling guide that tells you exactly where to go and what to do. Brian's sharing his account with you. **This installs separately from CurseForge/WowUp.**

## 6. Druid Tips (If You Go That Route) 🐻

Druid is the **Swiss Army Knife** class - you can literally do everything:

| Spec | Role | Playstyle |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Guardian** | Tank | Big bear, take hits, lead dungeons |
| **Feral** | Melee DPS | Cat form, bleeds and combos, rogue-like |
| **Balance** | Ranged DPS | Moonkin/Boomie, lasers and dots |
| **Restoration** | Healer | HoTs (heal over time), chill healing style |

### Druid Leveling Perks
- **Travel Form** - Instant cast mount while leveling. Huge quality of life.
- **Flight Form** - Once you unlock flying, you get instant-cast flight. No mounting animation.
- **Stealth** - Cat form has stealth. Skip mobs you don't want to fight.
- **Self-Healing** - Every spec can off-heal in a pinch.

### Don't Stress About Spec
You can swap specs anytime once you unlock them (by level 10). Try them all. Zygor works with any spec.
